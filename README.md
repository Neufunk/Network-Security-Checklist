# Network-Security-Checklist

Safeguard your digital fortress: utilize firewalls, IDS/IPS, and secure VPNs. Enforce strong passwords, MFA, and least privilege access. Classify and encrypt sensitive data, and back it up regularly. Maintain security hygiene with software updates, anti-malware, log monitoring, user training, and an incident response plan. Consider network segmentation, strong encryption algorithms, and regular security assessments for further fortification. Remember, vigilance is key in the ever-evolving battle against cyber threats.
